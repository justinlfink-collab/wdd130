        <img src="./images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello I am Justin Fink" width="200">
        <p>Hello I am Justin Fink and live in Utah, about an hour south of Salt Lake City, with
            my
            wife and best friend,
            Tiffany. I have
            more than 30 years of experience in IT and technology leadership, with a career that
            spans
            consulting, developing enterprise platforms, and leading teams through complex
            change.
            Throughout my
            career, I’ve worked in both hands-on and leadership roles, helping organizations
            modernize
            operations, drive digital transformation, and address complex challenges, resulting
            in
            measurable
            outcomes. In my current role, I serve as a Solutions Consultant, partnering with
            account
            teams and
            customer leaders to shape strategy, articulate value, and guide organizations in
            leveraging the
            ServiceNow platform and AI to transform their businesses and achieve real-world
            results.
        </p>

        <p>I’ve always had a strong passion for technology and the way it continually evolves to
            create new
            possibilities. More recently, I’ve been actively using AI in both my professional
            and
            personal
            projects, experimenting with it to build applications, streamline processes, and
            explore
            innovative
            approaches to problem-solving. I’m particularly interested in how AI can augment
            decision-making,
            improve efficiency, and enable people to focus on more strategic and meaningful
            work.
            That same
            curiosity extends to my home automation projects, where I enjoy integrating
            technology
            into everyday
            life to create smarter, more efficient, and more intuitive systems.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, my life revolves around family, church, school, and projects.
            Tiffany
            and I have
            three children. Our two youngest are married, and while there are no grandchildren
            yet,
            we’re
            enjoying this season of life together. Family time, shared experiences, and faith
            play a
            central
            role in my life.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is tackling projects around the house. I enjoy building
            things, learning
            new skills, and seeing ideas come to life. This past year, I completed a 24×30-foot
            workshop to
            support future projects, and my next major endeavor is building a covered deck off
            the
            house to
            finally finish the backyard. Whether it involves construction, home improvement,
            automation,
            application development, or helping customers get the most value from the ServiceNow
            platform and
            AI, I enjoy the process of building, improving, and learning along the way.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, I’m a lifelong learner who values meaningful work, strong
            relationships, and
            the satisfaction that comes from building—whether that’s teams, technology
            solutions,
            AI-driven
            applications and agents, or a deck in the backyard.</p>

        <h2>Utah</h2>
        <img src=" ./images/utah1.jpg" alt="Welcome to Utah">
        <p>Utah is a western U.S. state known for its striking natural beauty, rich
            history, and
            strong sense
            of community. It is home to diverse landscapes ranging from towering
            mountains and
            alpine forests to
            red rock deserts and five iconic national parks. Utah’s economy blends
            outdoor
            recreation,
            technology, agriculture, and tourism, while its culture reflects both
            pioneer heritage
            and modern
            innovation. With a focus on family life, faith, and outdoor living, Utah
            offers a unique
            balance of
            natural adventure and growing urban centers.</p>
